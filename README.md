# SublimeAndroid

This is a work in progress!

Expects a properly configured android project via command line tools. From project directory:

```
android update project -p ./
```

## Current Roadmap

* xml layout autocompletion (somewhat done)
* project configuration related to location of sublime-project file
* sane defaults for external plugins (SublimeJava, SublimeLinter, etc) if possible
* build configurations related to ant or push changes to upstream sublime ant projects to handle includes
